    The development and maintenance of the Ohana Network is tracked on <a href="https://github.com/Laurcons/ohana-network" target="_blank">the project's GitHub repository</a>.
    Reporting bugs, suggesting features, and peeking at upcoming features can be done there. It's important to note that the GitHub repo only stores the website's codebase,
    and that the user information and all other data required to make the site work is stored securely, privately and only on the webserver that the website runs on.

<p>
    Your personal information is securely stored on a webserver in Frankfurt that only I have direct access to. It will not be used for anything other than running this
    website, specifically any activities or functionalities that might make use of your data. It's recommended you put your real information in, but if sharing this data
    is not something you intend on doing, submitting fake information will work too.
