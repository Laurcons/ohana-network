## Contributing
Feel free to contribute!

The main way you can contribute in is to create issues in the Issues tab. If you found a bug with the platform, you can open a new Issue and detail the problem there. This allows me to better track the evolution of the issue and fix it as soon as possible. **NOTE!** Issues are NOT limited to bugs: they can also contain suggestions or ideas, which are also important to be tracked.

You can also help with the code, even if you're not a group member. Any pull request (or Issue related to code) is welcome!
